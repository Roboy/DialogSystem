World Interfaces
****************

A world interace is any external service, device, etc. that enables the Dialog System to interact with the world outside of the dialog system. Interaction with a *World Interface* is provided to a conversation via *InputDevices* and *OutputDevices*. Some need to be initialized or controlled which would be done by the *ConversationManager*. This page is a list of currently supported *World Interfaces* and provides information on how to use them and how they work.

ROS
===

.. NOTE::
    **Robot interface**

The Robot Operating System (ROS) provides an interface so the dialog manager may be deployed as the brain of roboy. It provides a way to communicate with the actual hardware and using its many ways of acting on and sensing the world as in- and outputs.

The memory, vision, emotion, speech, generative model and middleware communication is carried out through RosMainNode object which implements AbstractNodeMain
(inheriting NodeListener of rosjava) and offering the control through the following important methods:

    - onStart
    - onShutdown
    - onShutdownComplete
    - onError

Currently, it also provides with the next custom methods:

    - SynthesizeSpeech
    - RecognizeSpeech
    - GenerateAnswer
    - ShowEmotion
    - DetectIntent
    - addListener
    - waitForLatchUnlock



Cerevoice
=========

.. NOTE::
    **I/O Device**

Choose ``cerevoice`` in- and output in ``config.properties``.

Cerevoice is a software for speech-to-text and text-to-speech processing. An external cerevoice software instance must be provided in order for the Dialog System to use this.



UDP
===

.. NOTE::
    **I/O Device**

Choose ``udp`` in- and output in ``config.properties``.

The dialog system may recieve and send in- and output that needs no further processing through a udp port configured in ``config.properties``.

Bing
====

.. NOTE::
    **Input Device**

Choose ``bing`` input in ``config.properties``.

Bing speech-to-text processing. Requires internet connection and the ``roboy_speech_recognition`` ROS package.

Command line
============

.. NOTE::
    **I/O Device**

Choose ``cmd`` in- and output in ``config.properties``.

In- and output via the command line in which the Dialog System is launched. Pure text-based in- and output.

Telegram
========

.. NOTE::
    **I/O Device**

Choose ``telegram`` in- and output in ``config.properties``.

Use a telegram bot to interface with the world. See :ref:`configuration_telegram_bot` for more information.

If the dialog system has been configured to use telegram as input world interface, the command line switches into control mode where an operator may use the ``shutdown`` command for a safe shutdown or ``byeAndShutdown``, which makes the dialog system properly say goodbye to active interlocutors before shutting down.
