World Interfaces
****************

A world interace is any external service, device, etc. that enables the Dialog System to interact with the world outside of the dialog system. Interaction with a *World Interface* is provided to a conversation via *InputDevices* and *OutputDevices*. Some need to be initialized or controlled which would be done by the *ConversationManager*. This page is a list of currently supported *World Interfaces* and provides information on how to use them and how they work.

ROS
===

.. NOTE::
    **Robot interface**

The Robot Operating System (ROS) provides an interface so the dialog manager may be deployed as the brain of roboy. It provides a way to communicate with the actual hardware and using its many ways of acting on and sensing the world as in- and outputs.

The memory, vision, emotion, speech, generative model and middleware communication is carried out through RosMainNode object which implements AbstractNodeMain
(inheriting NodeListener of rosjava) and offering the control through the following important methods:

    - onStart
    - onShutdown
    - onShutdownComplete
    - onError

Currently, it also provides with the next custom methods:

    - SynthesizeSpeech
    - RecognizeSpeech
    - GenerateAnswer
    - ShowEmotion
    - CreateMemoryQuery
    - UpdateMemoryQuery
    - GetMemoryQuery
    - DeleteMemoryQuery
    - CypherMemoryQuery
    - DetectIntent
    - addListener
    - waitForLatchUnlock



Cerevoice
=========

.. NOTE::
    **I/O Device**
Chose ``cerevoice`` in- and output in ``config.properties``.

Cerevoice is a software for speech-to-text and text-to-speech processing. An external cerevoice software instance must be provided in order for the Dialog System to use this.



UDP
===

.. NOTE::
    **I/O Device**
Chose ``udp`` in- and output in ``config.properties``.

The dialog system may recieve and send in- and output that needs no further processing through a udp port configured in ``config.properties``.

Bing
====

.. NOTE::
    **Input Device**
Chose ``bing`` input in ``config.properties``.

Bing speech-to-text processing. Requires internet connection and the ``roboy_speech_recognition`` ROS package.

Command line
============

.. NOTE::
    **I/O Device**
Chose ``cmd`` in- and output in ``config.properties``.

In- and output via the command line in which the Dialog System is launched. Pure text-based in- and output.

Telegram
========

.. NOTE::
    **I/O Device**
Chose ``telegram`` in- and output in ``config.properties``.

Use a telegram bot to interface with the world. In order to use this, register a bot Register a bot as described on the `telegram website`_. And place your telegram-bot authentification token in a JSON-File structured like this:
.. _telegram website: https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot


.. code:: json
{
    "TOKEN":"AAAAAAAAA:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
    "BOT_USERNAME":"Botname"
}

Provide the path to this file to the Dialog System via ``TELEGRAM_API_TOKENS_FILE: "/path/to/example.json"`` in ``config.properties``.
