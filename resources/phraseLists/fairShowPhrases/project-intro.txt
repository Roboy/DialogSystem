let me tell you a bit about myself. I am a humanoid robot, developed by several Universities and I'm already in the second generation. I am really happy to be here today and spend my time at this nice booth. Please feel free to have a chat with one of the team members. They are always glad to spam innocent people with all their knowledge.
