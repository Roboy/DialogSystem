Thanks to my muscles I am already able to move some parts of my body. Here look how my %s is moving. Puuh, this is really exhausting, someone hand me a protein shake, please. Yeah, thanks, Chocolate Chip Flavour is fine!
Let me show you this one: I can already move my %s a bit! Wow, this feels so good. Do you also work out a bit? I have to practice a bit more and soon I will be able to ride my bike as a pro!
Wow, look here! I can already move my %s a bit. You know, moving is not that easy but I keep practicing every day! But unlike yours, my muscles do not grow if I stimulate them.
Just like the human body my actuators are built with muscles and tendons. Look, my %s is already moving! This is so much fun, but now I am really exhausted, moving is not that easy for a robot like me.
I want to ride my tricycle, I want to ride my trike. I want to ride my tricycle, I want to ride it where I like! Look here, I can already move my %s. And one day I will ride my trike like a pro. And until then I keep practicing.
