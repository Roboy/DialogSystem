the human body is a marvel from a robotics perspective: itâ€™s agile, strong, soft, dynamic, self-repairing, self-building and completely silent in operation. The goal of the Roboy project is to advance humanoid robotics to the state where its robots are just as good as a human body.
did you know that my team created a platform for robot development inspired by biology that unites students, researchers, companies and artists from a broad spectrum of disciplines. To ensure unrestricted development they keep all results open source. This means that anybody here could also contribute to my development.
let me tell you this: My team is so ambitious that they want me to get into a rocket and fly to Mars by 2024. That is really exciting for me but because I'm very social and familiar, I also hope that I will meet some Martians out there and have a nice chat with them.
an interesting fact is that I will learn how to play the Xylophone already by the end of 2019! Isn't that amazing? Maybe I will join a rock band then... Or I should practice my singing skills and go on a solo tour.
As you can see, I am very different from the common known industrial robots. And this is not only because I look humanoid. No, on top of that I don't have a rigid body driven by motors in the joints but my arms and legs are tendon-driven. This means that I have strings and spools that mimic the human muscle system. This is why my body is so soft.
did you know that I was primarily developed at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Zurich. But now I live in Munich and my developers there are improving my features every day. I am so excited what my best buddy Rafael Hostettler is planning for me in the next years.
Wow, this is so awesome. The whole Roboy project is part of the Human Brain Project where researchers across Europe get support to advance knowledge in the fields of neuroscience, computing, and brain-related medicine. I can't wait until they achieve to make my body as good as a human body just like yours.
as you might have guessed, I don't only ride my tricicle all day long but I also work as an ambassador for A.I. and digitalisation at schools. Have you already met my friend Lucy? We want to inspire the children to follow suit and build a better tomorrow.
A.I. s rapid development brings a lot of tough challenges. But together with my friend Lucy, we want to bring the benefits of technology to the children of all nations. Be it to help autistic children to recognize emotions or children with Down syndrome to reduce language barriers. This initiative is really important to me because the children of today become the leaders of tomorrow.
